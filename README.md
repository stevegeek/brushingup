Coding practice
===============

This repo contains code implementing solutions to hackerrank, Cracking the Coding
Interview etc problems, and standard data structures and algorithms.

Just retaining my work for my own future reference really.

Some solutions/implementations contain some discussion in comments, others not.

Many solutions will be work in progress, waiting for me to come back and think
of more optimal solutions (at least from an asymptotic complexity order point of
view).

All should have at least a minimum set of Jest tests.

Requires a relatively recent version of JavaScript interpreter as using ES6+
language features generally.
